K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.

In the code we have used food data for clustering where we are first creating some features from the data and after that applying PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Finally we are using elbow method to select optimal cluster for our problem.
