Random Forest code for Multivariate Time series forecasting, with options for Scaling, Hyperparameter Tuning and using Demand Lags for predicting the future numbers.
In the code I have used the concept of multi step forecasting, where I am also using the forecasted number for future prediction. Same code can be used for other multivariate algorithms
such as LGBM,XGB with little adjustment to the Hyperparaeter tuning parameters.
